        I offer virtual tutoring for college mathematics courses, with specialties in linear algebra and
        statistics. Sessions are tailored to student needs, such as working through homework problems together or
        reviewing content. Sessions are recorded and sent to students to review on their own. Please <a class="active"
            href="contact.html">contact me</a> for more information!</small></p>

<h4>Experience:</h4>
<p class="content" style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
    I received my Master's degree in applied mathematics from Johns Hopkins University (JHU) in 2019, and have since
    been a Ph.D. student in statistics at the University of Washington (UW).
    While at JHU, I was a tutor for student athletes and students from disadvantaged backgrounds as
    part of the Center for Student Success, in courses such as multivariate calculus, discrete mathematics, and Python
    programming. I have also been a teaching assistant for statistics and linear algebra courses at the Ph.D. level.
    Additionally,
    have taught my own course on mathematics preparation for engineering at JHU. Please see my <a class="active"
