I recently received my Ph.D. from the [Department of Statistics](http://www.stat.washington.edu/) at the University of Washington, and was fortunate to be advised by [Zaid Harchaoui](https://faculty.washington.edu/zaid/). Previously, I was an undergraduate and Master's student in the [Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics](https://engineering.jhu.edu/ams/)
at Johns Hopkins University, advised by [Joshua T. Vogelstein](https://jovo.me/)
and [Carey Priebe](https://www.ams.jhu.edu/~priebe/).

I am broadly interested in machine learning and optimization. My current research focuses on optimization and statistical learning methods across a number of applications, including distributional robustness and self-supervised learning.
