  <p class="lead">
  I am a PhD candidate in the <a href = "http://www.stat.washington.edu/">Department of Statistics</a> 
    at the University of Washington. My current research is focused on model development for compositional data applied to the
    microbiome, advised by 
    <a href = "https://faculty.washington.edu/dwitten/">Daniela Witten</a> and 
    <a href = "https://faculty.washington.edu/adwillis/">Amy Willis</a>. 
More generally, my research objectives emphasize the development of user-friendly, statistically sound, and open-source software that addresses practical scientific challenges and empowers non-statisticians/data scientists to work more directly with their data.
    My research is supported by an 
<a href="http://www.nsfgrfp.org/">NSF Graduate Research Fellowship</a>. <br/>
<br/>
Outside of research, I prioritize statistics education and initiatives related to equity.
My teaching objectives emphasize undergraduate statistics education and teaching statistical literacy and best practices to non-statisticians.
Inside and outside of my teaching, I actively try to leverage my position to advocate for and work towards building more equitable communities and cultures within statistics, as well as STEM and academia more broadly, at all levels.
<br/>
<br/>
Before coming to UW, I was an undergraduate at <a href = " https://www.macalester.edu/">Macalester College</a> 
    where I received degrees in statistics and economics.
